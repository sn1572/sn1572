- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sn1572
- ðŸ‘€ My professional interests are in HPC, cloud architectures, web app dev (and all that goes with it), and machine learning. In my spare time, sometimes I work on projects which are tracked here. Also I like mountain biking and building mountain bike trails. I am a board (not boreed!) member of the local SORBA (Southern Off Road Bicycle Association) chapter.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve just started making contributions to cusignal!
