- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sn1572
- ðŸ‘€ My professional interests center around machine learning, software engineering (especially in the cloud), and digital signal processing. Sometimes I work on various projects which get tracked publically here on Github.
- ðŸŒ± I've been working on a hobby game engine for a few years now, "Evyl9". It is a Python package that uses Numpy for memory management and has C backing for performance critical portions of code. It provides an OpenGL binding so you can write OGL code in plain Python - with context management provided separately. This project is currently private but maybe someday will find its way to the public domain. :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot an e-mail.
