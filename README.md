- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sn1572
- ðŸ‘€ My professional interests are in HPC, computer vision, and machine learning, but those projects have to remain private :(. In my spare time, sometimes I work on projects which are tracked here. Also I like mountain biking and building mountain bike trails. I am a board member of the local SORBA chapter.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning opengl! Making my way through the tutorials at [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com/). Professionally I am learning about Linux device drivers, as well as tools for packaging our projects (autotools for example).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot an e-mail.
